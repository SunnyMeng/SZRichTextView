SZRichTextView
==============

SZRichTextView is yet another implementation of rich text editor on iOS, aiming to be light-weight, fast and convenient.

###Existing Implementations

Other rich text editor on iOS are mainly implemented in 2 ways:

####CoreText

CoreText is good, but in order to implement a rich text editor, much work needs to be done. For example, the "maginifying glass" effect.

A not-well-implemented CoreText rich text editor can be slow and buggy, while a well-implemented one can be much too complicated to be customized.

####HTML

HTML is also a good way to implement a rich text editor on iOSï¼Œfor example, the rich text editor of Evernote.

But anything related to UIWebView will be full of hacks, which is hard to maintain, especially during major iOS upgrades.

###Why SZRichTextView?

In fact, SZRichTextView is 'not' a dedicated rich text editor, but it mimics a rich text editor, which, in my case, solves my problem perfectly.

Below images illustrates what SZRichTextView can do.

######SZRichTextView layouts segments of text along with images or customized attachments.

######Attachments can be deleted.

###Under the hood

SZRichTextView uses PSTCollectionView internally for better customization.

UICollectionView 'may' be used instead.(NOT TESTED)
